# Flowchain - Method Chaining for TensorFlow

Extensive and simple tensor method chaining for TensorFlow

Install via:
```
pip install flowchain
```

Add only 2 lines of code at the top of your code!
```python
from flowchain import enable_tensor_chaining

enable_tensor_chaining()  # this does everything for you.
```

This package makes following approach possible:
```python
# before
x = tf.abs(lhs - rhs)
x = tf.reduce_sum(x, 1)
x = tf.argmin(x, output_type=tf.int32)

# after
x = (lhs - rhs).abs().reduce_sum(1).argmin(output_type=tf.int32)
```
